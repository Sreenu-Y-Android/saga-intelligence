// special_leader/constituency_manager) and by Geographic Intelligence's
// Constituency Explorer tab. A blanket `/geographic-intelligence` page gate
// would break the home page for users who don't hold that permission, so
// instead: already-scoped callers pass straight through; only a
// canSeeAll-but-not-superadmin caller (a legacy/back-office/party-leadership

// state-wide visibility) additionally needs the Geographic Intelligence page
// permission before it can pull the full 175-seat dataset.
