/**
 * Local-calendar-day YYYY-MM-DD formatting, shared across the Geographic

 * "today"/date-range boundary by up to 5.5 hours, which is why every date
 * default in this module goes through this one helper instead of each
 * component reimplementing its own (and risking exactly that bug, as
 * happened with Historical Playback's date-range presets previously).
